### Description
Refactor a fully operational RESTful Google Books API search engine into a GraphQL API created using Apollo Server. With a React front end, a MongoDB database, a Node.js/Express.js server, and an Express.js API, the initial project was created utilizing the MERN stack. Users could already save book searches to the back end thanks to the configuration.
